README.txt
==========
This is a theme created for the Las Vegas Drupal Users Group (LVDUG). It is based on, and requires, Bartik.

To put a horizontal menu at the top of the web site, add the menu block to the Featured region, not the Header region. The header itself comprises an image, and thus the logo, site name, and slogan can only be altered in the file templates/page.tpl.php, and not by using the Drupal 7 themes user interface.
