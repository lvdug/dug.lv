==========
This is a simple theme created by Michael J. Ross (http://www.ross.ws/) for the Las Vegas Drupal Users Group (LVDUG). It is based on, and requires, Bartik.

To put a horizontal menu -- typically the Main menu -- near the top of your web site, add the menu block to the Featured region. You will likely want to disable the menu's block title.

Do not try to put any blocks in the Header region, because it comprises only two images (foreground and background). Thus the logo, site name, and slogan can only be altered in the file templates/page.tpl.php, and not by using the Drupal 7 theming user interface.

The images used in this theme are copyright by their respective copyright holders. The poker chip logo was created by Cramer Flatt (http://www.flattfamily.com/family-member/cramer).
