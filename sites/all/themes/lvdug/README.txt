README.txt
==========
This is a theme created for the Las Vegas Drupal Users Group (LVDUG). It is based on, and requires, Bartik.

To put a horizontal menu -- typically the Main menu -- at the top of the web site, add the menu block to the Featured region. You will likely want to disable the menu's block title.

Do not try to put any blocks the Header region, because it comprises only an image. Thus the logo, site name, and slogan can only be altered in the file templates/page.tpl.php, and not by using the Drupal 7 themes user interface.
